### Serve it

Your Finda application is working on your local computer, but it's not online yet.

If you already have a hosting service, you can use their upload manager or an FTP client to upload the files to your hosting service.

If you do not have a hosting service, find and subscribe to one. [FatCow](http://www.fatcow.com/) is pretty okay. [Please][1] [don't][2] [use][3] [GoDaddy][4].

Once you have a service, upload all of the files to the root folder (sometimes referred to as just '/'), or upload the entire folder to the host and configure your domain name to point to that folder.
